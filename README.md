# Spigot-Plugin-2
One example of my abilities to work on/ patch minigames with spigot development

This example of code is INCOMPLETE. The reason is that- this test server doesn't have a mainframe platform to work from. I also would have no way to test code in regards to managing multiple players.
Overall, this code is just a proof of concept that I can work on the minigame.
